This is the raw data for the 150 protein test set described in:

PSICOV: precise structural contact prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation on large multiple sequence alignments.
D.T. Jones, D. W. A. Buchan, D. Cozzetto & M. Pontil. Bioinformatics (2012) 28 (2): 184-190.

The alignments correspond to the sequence represented in each PDB file (missing atoms have been added where necessary). So there
are exactly the same number of columns in each alignment as C-alpha ATOM records in each PDB file as gaps relative to the target
sequence have been removed.

Directory information:

aln - contains the alignments. One aligned sequence per line with no header information.
seq - contains the target sequences in FASTA format.
con - contains the predictions made using PSICOV and the given alignments.
pdb - contains the repaired and renumbered PDB files for the 150 targets.

The format of the .out files is as follows:

column 1 - Residue number i
column 2 - Residue number j
column 3 - Minimum distance (dummy value - ignore!)
column 4 - Maximum distance (dummy value - ignore!)
column 5 - Contact prediction score (sorted by this column)
